The existing culverts will be extended and/or the headwalls will be replaced with flared end section as required. The existing guardrail will be removed and replaced.  Because the pavement work is considered to result in an alteration of the pavement in crosswalks, the NDOR will eliminate barriers to access by building curb ramps where required. "

4/7/20 - Note from Kelly Kalvelage (PM) - Due to the present circumstances, the Department of Residence has chosen to cancel this project. Unfortunately that also means we will be terminating design services. This is by no means a reflection of the services you have provided. Schemmer has done an outstanding job and I look forward to working with you all on our other projects. 
To close this project, an amendment will be processed. The project was canceled at 1% of construction. The contract equivalent amount to this is $30,248.01. Therefore, a deduct amendment will be processed for $10,576.99 – the balance for 99% construction and 100% record documents."

(NFPA 70E) and identified in the Base Wide ARC Flash Report completed in 2011.  B600 classified as a Category 0 for ARC Flash protection.  Domestic water system is inefficient and is approaching its expected lifespan.  The current configuration will be altered to support new functions and moving of existing functions in the facility.  Some of the systems components need to be replaced.  This also contributes to the increasing costs of utilities.  Scope of this project is validated by NGCB122122 - Planning Study for B600.  The planning study was conducted by an A/E firm and relocated the space utilization within B600.  In addition, the study looked at consolidating other functions from other facilities into B600.  Planning study recommends moving wing staff functions, MSG, functions and touch services out of B600 and into B2945.  It also recommends moving Operations out of B2945 and into B600 as well as the engine shop out of B605 and into B600.  The end result of the planning study provided an efficient use of space while consolidating all existing space from three separate buildings into two facilities.  Operations and Maintenance functions will be primarily contained within B600 as a result of this project.  ATFP will be addressed with this project.  Lastly, this project is ranked as the 155 ARW #1 project on the Installation Development Plan dated April 2012.  Required to provide Maintenance Facility that is durable, functional, economical, safe, aesthetically pleasling, and have reasonable operating and maintenance costs according to AFH 32-1084."

The project consists of a renovation of the building spaces at the Papillion Service Center located at 96th and Cornhusker.  The full design will be done concurrently, but will be packaged to be constructed in three phases.  Project will be design-bid-build with one general contractor performing all three phases of work.
Office:  A full interior renovation will be done to the office and restroom spaces.  This includes flooring, paint, ceilings, ductwork and lighting.  The existing fire alarm system will be updated with horn strobes and one of the RTU’s will be replaced.  The existing 400 gallon water heater will be replaced with smaller water heaters to eliminate the required boiler inspections.
Line Docks:  General work will consist of paint, lighting and lockers.  The coffee/vending area will be enclosed and consideration will be made to add a boot wash and washer/dryer.  The exercise area will be finished out with cooling and ventilation.  The concrete around the existing trench drain will need to be repaired.  The in floor heat system will need reviewed.
Stores:  General work will consist of paint and lighting.  The office area will be reviewed and expanded to accommodate 6 people.
Transportation:  General work will consist of paint and lighting.  The restroom will require renovation.  The bulk fluid room will need to be reviewed and potentially modified by relocating some of the storage to another location.  The exterior of the building will need to be reviewed with potential tuck pointing required.
Tool Room:  The restroom will require renovation.
General Items:  Electrical panels throughout all spaces will need reviewed and potentially replaced.  The exterior lighting will need to be reviewed and potentially replaced.  The generator and electrical gear will need to be reviewed.  Exterior windows will need to be reviewed and potentially replaced.  The total budget for the project is $3,752,296 (including design, construction, furniture, AV, etc.)"

PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Lincoln Transportation and Utilities (LTU) Department currently has three street maintenance facilities and is looking into the possibility of acquiring an additional (existing) facility as part of on-going operations, which may allow the opportunity for elimination of a current, outdated site.
The Maintenance Facility Assessment should give LTU clear direction for planning purposes on how maintenance facilities should best be planned, upgraded or replaced. The goal for this project is to plan for both the next 10 years and at the City’s build-out of Tier II, estimated to be in 2060, with a future City population of 470,000.
The Maintenance Facility Assessment will assist LTU in determining if existing facilities and locations are adequate or if new facilities are needed to replace one or more of the existing locations. The assessment will also identify potential future sites, if necessary, and estimated cost to obtain needed land,  as well as the current market value of the existing facility properties to assist LTU in determining the best use or reuse for those properties."

The project consists of two parts – a cattle pen expansion and an additional paunch loadout bay.  A concept layout of the cattle pen expansion has been provided by Creekstone to graphically represent the general layout.  Construction of the cattle pen expansion is anticipated to be precast concrete, consistent with the existing building construction.  Modifications to the existing structure will be required for movement of the cattle.  Additionally other plant modifications will be required at the drainage pit and the existing lift station will need to be relocated.  The paunch loadout is currently located on the north side of the plant.  It is anticipated that the loading area can be extended inside the existing building and an additional overhead door can be added for the truck access.  The design of the project will be phased with the initial concepts being used to establish the overall scope of the project and for use in determining the project budget.  Final design will be provided following funding and authorization of the full project."
